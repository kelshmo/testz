# testz

This repo is a sandbox for me to test out the Synapse programmatic clients.

Added:
-a 125.csv file (an open scv file from synapse)
-a .py scripts with functions than read the csv file
 e. function has been documented in what they do.

what is does:

read and enumerate the columns of the file

return a dictionary with information related to each example and its attributes.

count the instances of one categorical column and print the count per element, 
in this case is a count per country where the Developer_Country is.

# updates

As well re-organizing the code offered before this commit
with the comentaries in mind, and focus in manipulation of 
the frames for concatenation. 
 * 2 entities created from synapseclient
 * a third randomly created data set w/ similar characteristics for experimentation.
